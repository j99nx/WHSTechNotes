what i think about the new phone ban is not good and good at the same time and my evidence is that people in school now that dont use a phone no more they are finaly listing in class and they are passing in class and and the bad reason why its not good that they baned the phones in school is because what if your in emergency or there is a school shooting and your parents dont know about you can probly die or get hurt or sick and what if someone has a gun school how can you call 911 and the polices that a kid has a weapon in campus and anthor thing is what if your parents are texting you and you cant see because of the new phone policey  so i do feel like its a good that they band it but at the same time because what if there is an a emergnacy and how i think should fix it is dont use your phone during lesson hours and use during non lesson hours use your phone if its an emergnacy so thats how i feel like the phone band should be fix
my claim that coumpter sicence is changing evrything is that everthing world has became more of techonlogy andd for my evidence that coumpter sicence is changing the world is thaat a lot of people are making websites and cool stuff in the internet as in back when there was no phone's and techonlogy you had to join a club or sign papers to join a progam and for reasoning is that we should keep using the internet for my stuff
What 67 means is just a meme that was pulled from a music video as the rapper said 67 and then people in the internet statred saying becuase they like how the rapper said it so now people say it becuse it popular and i guess people love to say it
