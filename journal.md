what i think about the new phone ban is not good and good at the same time and my evidence is that people in school now that dont use a phone no more they are finaly listing in class and they are passing in class and and the bad reason why its not good that they baned the phones in school is because what if your in emergency or there is a school shooting and your parents dont know about you can probly die or get hurt or sick and what if someone has a gun school how can you call 911 and the polices that a kid has a weapon in campus and anthor thing is what if your parents are texting you and you cant see because of the new phone policey  so i do feel like its a good that they band it but at the same time because what if there is an a emergnacy and how i think should fix it is dont use your phone during lesson hours and use during non lesson hours use your phone if its an emergnacy so thats how i feel like the phone band should be fix

If i was in charge of a school, first i would let people use ai but on certain stuff like if you don't understand an asignment or a question i would let them use ai and for the phone policy i woulden't have one because what if there is an emerangcy and the nurse can't get there becuase she doing something and anthor rule i will add is you can't use ur phone during work hours and if you do use it during work hours you will get in trouble and thats all my rules if had a school oh and for techonlgey i would lwt them use computers.

Who I think is foing to be affected is snap, how i think technology would help us if they can find website's that are safe to use so we don't get scam, the challenges i think of not using technology is you won't get to find out what is happing in the world, if I had a website to like help people i would call it the juan helper.

I feel like technology hasen't really changed holidays because not that much people really post any holidays a lot. I don't fell like it effects the holidays because nothing really happinig to any of the holidays. I feel like developers are not causing any family bonding time because you get to see your son or daughter open a presnet that you bought for them and when they open the present they are happy that you bought them that present so I feel like it's not the developers fault.

why i think cars should stop if the bus driver puts the stop sign is that what if a kid drops something on the road and he can't do anything becuase the road is full with cars driving and other thing its a law that people have to stop on a stop sign.
